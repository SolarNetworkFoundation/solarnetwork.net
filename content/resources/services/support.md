For organisations with SolarNetwork systems spanning multiple sites, we offer comprehensive IT
planning and support services.

## Design your system

A large-scale SolarNetwork system requires some up-front planning to ensure that it works in the
ways your organisation needs it to now, and in the future.

SolarNetwork Foundation can help you:

* understand best practises for supporting SolarNode infrastructure
* model your long-term SolarNetwork costs, and how to keep them minimised
* design a standardised data taxonomy that best supports your organisation's needs
* design data retention policies
* standardise your organisation's SolarNode settings and plugins into a customised SolarNodeOS,
  making your node deployment and maintenance process easier in the long term
* implement software automation and operational tools that support your SolarNetwork infrastructure

## Keep your SolarNetwork system running smoothly

SolarNodes are designed to require a minimum amount of ongoing operational maintenance but, like any
IT infrastructure, they do require some attention to keep them running optimally.

SolarNetwork Foundation can help you:

* package and deploy SolarNode software updates
* troubleshoot SolarNode operational issues
* train your operations team to manage these tasks themselves
