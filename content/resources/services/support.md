Deploying a successful SolarNetwork-based system will benefit from a bit of up-front planning.
SolarNetwork Foundation can help you:

* understand best practises for supporting SolarNode infrastructure
* model your long-term SolarNetwork costs, and how to keep them minimised
* design a standardised data taxonomy that best supports your organisation's needs
* standardise your organisation's SolarNode settings and plugins into a customised SolarNodeOS,
  making your node deployment and maintenance process easier in the long term
* implement software automation and operational tools that support your SolarNetwork infrastructure
* design data retention policies

## Keep your SolarNetwork infrastructure running smoothly

SolarNodes are designed require a minimum amount of ongoing operational maintenance, but like any
IT infrastructure they do require some maintenance to keep them running optimally. SolarNetwork
Foundation can help you:

* package and deploy SolarNode software updates
* troubleshoot SolarNode operational issues
* train your operations team to manage these tasks themselves
