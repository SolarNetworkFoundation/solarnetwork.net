The promise of putting solar panels on your roof to lower your energy bill is a seductive one. With
a minimum of fuss, solar panels can be installed on your roof and start generating clean energy for
your building, potentially offsetting your power bill and making a positive impact on the
environment for years to come.

## Will my power bill go down?

Because solar panels only generate power during the day, the impact it has on your power bill will
depend on how much power you use _during the day_. If you generally use electricity all day, then a
solar power system can make a big impact on your power bill. If you are primarily away during the
day, however, much of the power generated by the solar panels will be exported to the grid. Your
local electricity retailer will have to agree to buy that exported energy, so the impact it has on
your power bill depends on the price they are willing to pay you for that power.

## Be solar smart

SolarNetwork Foundation can help you make smart decisions about solar power, ensuring you can
actually use a majority of the power you generate. A good first step we can help you with is to
perform an [energy audit](power-audit.html) so you understand how you use energy.

From there we can help you plan for and design a solar power system that levereges SolarNetwork,
producing a report that details:

 * the impact different sized solar power systems would have on your power bill
 * how a battery system could be used to store solar-generated energy for night-time use
 * how an electric vehical could be charged from solar power
 * how SolarNetwork can integrate with home automation systems to save even more money
 * how to participate in "smart grid" initiatives to save even more money
 * potential ways to fund the system

By making well-informed decisions on your solar system, the sun will be _empowering_ you to save
money and help your immediate environment.
