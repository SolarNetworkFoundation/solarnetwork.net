SolarNetwork Foundation can help you make smart decisions about solar power. Solar can be a great way to generate clean energy and make a positive impact on the environment for years to come.

Used well, it can also help you save on your power bills. We'll help you plan and design a solar system that provides you, and the planet, maximum benefit.

<!--
If you generally use electricity all day, then a
solar power system can make a big impact on your power bill. If you are primarily away during the
day, much of the power generated by the solar panels will be exported to the grid. Your
local electricity retailer will have to agree to buy that exported energy, so the impact it has on
your power bill depends on the price they are willing to pay you for that power.

## Be solar smart

Once you understand how much energy you're using (an [energy audit](power-audit.html) is the best way) we can help you plan for and design a solar system using SolarNetwork.

A bit of pre-planning goes a long way when it comes to getting the maximum benefit from solar power. We can advise you about the space required for solar, the likely impact on your power bill, and how you could make use of the power you generate.

## Design the best system

When you have decided that solar is right for you, we can plan a best-fit system using SolarNetwork. We'll produce a report that details:

 * the impact different-sized solar power systems would have on your power bill
 * how a battery system could be used to store solar-generated energy for night-time use
 * how an electric vehical could be charged from solar power
 * how SolarNetwork can integrate with home automation systems
 * how to participate in "smart grid" initiatives to save money

We can also use our expertise to help you come up with ways to fund your system.

By making well-informed decisions on your solar system, the sun will be empowering you to save
money and help the environment.
