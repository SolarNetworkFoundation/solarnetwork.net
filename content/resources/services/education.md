## Knowledge is power

Energy management is becoming a vital part of the way our earth runs. While it certainly is a long
journey, we are moving as a society toward more renewable, sustainable economy as the same time as
we are growing as a population. Everything we do here onward is going to have an energy component to
its design. No longer will energy use for an activity, a product design, a campaign be a secondary
afterthought - it will be built into the requirement from the get go. This means that our future
engineers, architects, procurement teams and politicians need tools to understand energy flows.

## Build SolarNetwork into your science curriculum

There is no better time than the present to get started on a compelling science curriculum that
involves energy data. Students need to have access to the kind of energy and energy planning systems
that the future will need. This future is going to be about distruibuted generation, mobile apps,
real-time analytics, tight integration with building management systems and appliances. It is going
to need tools that supply decision makers with up to the minute optimisation schemes, energy
forecasts that take local weather into account and local clean generation of renewable energy from
solar and wind.  What a perfect time to start the experiments, put the tools in the hands of your
students, and give them the experience of a lifetime.

## Start today

There are many schools out there today that employ SolarNetwork to measure their solar generation
and their power consumption in real time. Take a look at what they are doing, and build on it. The
energy data laboratory of the future is available right now, and to get started all you need is a
SolarNode.
