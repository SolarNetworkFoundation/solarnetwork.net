SolarNewtork Foundation is committed to supporting the educational use of SolarNetwork.

We understand that good information about energy use is increasingly central to decision making in all parts of society. We also know that researchers of all ages, from children through to professionals and academics, rely on good energy data to make informed choices and imagine future initiatives.

Our current and future engineers, scientists, architects, business people, and politicians need tools to understand energy flows; all of us benefit from a better understanding of how the energy we rely on is generated and used.

## Build SolarNetwork into your research platform

SolarNetwork Foundation is ready to support researchers and educators to make use of the data collected in SolarNetwork. Schools, universities, and research institutes can benefit from any of the services SolarNetwork Foundation offers to collect and manage their own energy data. In addition, anyone can make use of publicly available data already in SolarNetwork as the basis for further inquiry.

SolarNetwork's rich ecosystem includes data about energy generation and use, weather and forecasting, energy market pricing, real-time power grid demand, and electric vehicle use.

## Start today

Many schools, businesses, and research organisations already use SolarNetwork to measure their solar generation and power consumption. Take a look at what they are doing, and we'll help you build on it.
