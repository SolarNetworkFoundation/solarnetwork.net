## Tell people all about it

Energy environments vary enormously between people, organisations, and places. Things like the
amount of energy used or generated, when energy is used or generated, what energy is used for, and
the equipment delivering energy are unique.  Seeing your energy visualised via SolarNetwork will
help you develop a strategy for saving money and lowering your carbon footprint over time. Sharing
your efforts and outcomes with others is an excellent way to then help others learn from _your_
energy story.

## We can help you

SolarNetwork Foundation can help you design a custom dashboard, mobile app, or learning tool to
convey the benefits of your energy policy to the world. We can also help you integrate real-time
data and interactive visualizations into your own website or app.

## Conclusion

Sharing your energy story is a great way to proudly demonstrate your sustainability credentials to
the rest of the world. What are you waiting for? Go ahead and put yourself out there!
