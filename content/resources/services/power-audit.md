## How am I using power?

Power bills are one way that we understand how much energy we are using, but the information they
provide is too brief and comes too late to answer many questions about your energy use. You might
ask:

 * When do I use the most energy?
 * What appliance uses the most energy in my building?
 * What kind of carbon footprint do I have?
 * What does my energy use look like over a typical week or day?
 * Do I use more energy on rainy days?
 * What would a rooftop solar array do to my energy bill?

## Visualise your energy flow

SolarNetwork is a great way for homes and businesses to answer these questions and more. The data
catpured by SolarNetwork can power web-based live interactive charts of your energy trends. You can
overlay local weather information, electricity market information, and solar generation to make the
dashboard relevant to you. Not only can you measure your whole building's use, but with the right
metering setup you can break down your energy use by function - such as hot water use, lighting,
heating, and even refrigeration.  Patterns become evident as they develop, in real time, rather than
being a surprise at the end of the month when the power bill arrives.

## Make better energy decisions

Once you discover patterns in your energy use, you can make informed decisions based on the
evidence. At SolarNetwork Foundation, we can help you lower your energy bill, make better use of
renewable energy, and share your experience with others.

The charts below show average seasonal energy production and use at a primary school. Power
generation is shown above the horizontal axis, so _higher_ lines represent more power generation.
Power consumption is shown below the horizontal axis, so _lower_ lines represent more power
consumption. <span style="color: rgb(233, 167, 18); font-weight: 700;">Yellow lines</span> represent
summer, <span style="color: rgb(118, 33, 35); font-weight: 700;">burgundy lines</span> autumn, <span
style="color: rgb(128, 163, 183); font-weight: 700;">blue lines</span> winter, and <span
style="color: rgb(92, 135, 38); font-weight: 700;">green lines</span> spring.

The chart on the left shows average power generation and consumption per day of the week. You can
see immediately that this site uses much less power on weekends. The chart on the right shows
averages per hour of the day. You can see that in winter far more power is consumed, most of it
first thing in morning. This was attributed to electric heating, which used a good deal of energy to
warm the building up at the start of each work day.
