Western Springs College is one of the largest public schools in West Auckland, with a student roll
of over 2300 students between years 9 and 13. Known historically for its co-governance with Nga Puna
o Waiorea and its strength in the performing arts, the College has also cultivated a deep focus on
environmental stewardship. A new building designed to support solar modules on the roof offered the
WSC community the opportunity to “walk the talk” of sustainability, teach science curriculum, and
save money on energy bills.

Supporting a community project like this perfectly aligns with SolarNetwork Foundation’s values, and
we were keen to help out.

The outcome? A community-funded solar array, put to work not only for
power generation but for learning and teaching, using SolarNetwork.

## The challenge

 * Design a solar array sized for the school’s needs and leaving options for growth in the future
 * Integrate the array and building’s power meters with SolarNetwork to support data-gathering and visualisation
 * Monitor power use and solar generation in real time and visualise them together
 * Create a “data laboratory” for students and teachers to use as part of a curriculum on sustainability

## Making it a reality

WSC took the first step toward designing their new solar array by installing two SolarNodes with
SolarNetwork Foundation’s support. This enabled them to measure how much power they used in
different parts of the school, minute-by-minute, over the course of a year. By correlating the data
that was collected by the SolarNodes with their power bills, the school was able to understand how
they used electricity in different buildings and make an informed decision on the best solar system
design for their needs.

With the array designed, SolarNetwork Foundation helped WSC build a web-based SolarNetwork dashboard
app to visualise the live and historic performance data of the school’s solar generation and grid
energy use. Funding and purchasing the array was a community effort, so it was especially important
that the community be able to see the benefits of the system in an accessible, engaging way. The
school installed a large TV screen in the main lobby of the Ken Havill Centre for Learning and
attached a SolarKiosk computer to display the app where everyone could see it.

## Future learning

Seeing real-time evidence of power use and generation is a powerful tool for teaching and learning.
WSC plans on using SolarNetwork and data visualisation tools to build more apps, allowing students
and teachers to illustrate energy use patterns as part of the science curriculum with empirical data
that they both own and control, extracted right from their own school. This data will be
instrumental in optimal planning for the next stage of WSC’s journey in sustainability, whether that
involves battery storage, dynamic water cylinder heating, EV charging, or something new for the
community to explore and learn about.
