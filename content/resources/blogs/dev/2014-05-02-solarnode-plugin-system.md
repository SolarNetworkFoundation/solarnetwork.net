For a long time now, SolarNode development has been using the OSGi framework.

<!--more-->

To make full use of this and to empower the end SolarNetwork users, a lot of work has been done to
create the SolarNode plugin system.  This system allows end users to configure their nodes by
browsing the available plugins and downloading what they need (e.g. a plugin for a particular
electricity meter, or a SMA solar inverter etc).

A full writeup on how the plugin system was implemented and a demo on how the GUI works is available
here: [SolarNode plugin system](http://blog.greenstage.co.nz/2014/05/solarnode-plugin-system.html).
