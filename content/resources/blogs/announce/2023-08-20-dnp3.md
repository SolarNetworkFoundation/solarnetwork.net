SolarNetwork has added a fully-managed Distributed Network Protocol 3 ([DNP3][dnp3]) Remote Substation
(often referred to as an _Outstation_) server service, that DNP3 compliant Control Center (often
referred to as _Master_) applications can integrate with. DNP3 is commonly used in the energy and
water utility industries, and provides a convenient method of monitoring and controlling distributed
industrial equipment _in real time_ such as power inverters, meters, switches, and dynamic parameters.

A DNP3 outstation presents a list of readable _measurement_ data points and a list of modifiable
_control_ data points to the connected client. In SolarNetwork, the measurements are configured as
SolarNode [datum stream][datum-stream] properties, and controls are configured as node controls. A
single outstation can thus expose measurement and control data points across any node associated
with your SolarNetwork account.

The measurement and control entities can be defined using a simple comma separated values (CSV)
formatted file. You can also see our [example Google Sheet][example-csv] to use as a starting point.

## Robust management API

The new [SolarUser DNP3 API][solaruser-dnp3-api] provides a complete API for managing DNP3
outstation servers within your SolarNetwork account. Each outstation is independently configured
with authorization, measurement, and control settings.

## Strong network security

SolarNetwork uses TLS based encryption with mutal authentication (often referred to as _X.509 client
certificates_) to provide both an encrypted connection and client authorization. You configure a set
of "trusted" certificate authorities in your SolarNetwork account, and then a set of allowed client
certificate identities on each outstation. Only clients with the certificates that you specify,
signed by a certificate authority you trust, are allowed to connect to your DNP3 outstations.

## Simple management UI

We have added an easy-to-use management user interface to SolarNetwork. With point-and-click
simplicity you can provision as many DNP3 outstation servers as you like. They become available
immediately.
