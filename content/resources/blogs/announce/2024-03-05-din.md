SolarNetwork has added a fully-managed HTTP integration service that allows arbitrary devices and
systems to supply real-time measurements to SolarNetwork directly, converting them into [datum
streams][datum-stream], without using a SolarNode to collect the measurements. We call this service
Datum Input Endpiont, or just DIN for short.

<!--more-->

Many metering devices have the ability to post measurement data to arbitrary URLs using HTTP.
In some situations it might not be feasible or desirable to deploy a SolarNode device to capture
the measurement data from those devices, and that is where SolarNetwork's DIN service can help.

In SolarNetwork you can now configure a unique URL called an _endpoint_. You also configure
a set of _credentials_ that devices must use when posting data, and a _transform_ that converts
the measurement data into native SolarNetwork datum.

SolarNetwork offers a flexible Transform Service approach for configuring your transforms, where you
can pick from the available services supported by SolarNetwork. Right now we offer just one service,
the XSLT Transform Service, that allows you to configure an XSLT stylesheet that can convert
arbitrary XML or JSON measurement data into native SolarNetwork datum JSON. In the future, if a
specific device or service becomes popular enough, we can add a targeted Transform Service to
simplify the transform configuration such that no (or very little) custom development is necessary
to process the measurement data from that device.

## Simple management UI

We have added an easy-to-use DIN management user interface to [SolarNetwork][solaruser]. With
point-and-click simplicity you can provision as many DIN endpoints as you like. They become
available immediately.

We have also made it easy to test out the transform process, by providing a form where you can
post test measurement data and inspect the converted output.

## Robust management API

The new [SolarUser DIN API][solaruser-din-api] provides a complete API for managing DIN endpoints
within your SolarNetwork account. Each endpoint is independently configured with authorization and
transform settings.
