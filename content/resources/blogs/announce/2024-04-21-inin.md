SolarNetwork has added a fully-managed HTTP integration service that allows arbitrary devices and
systems to post arbitrary "messages" to SolarNetwork at a custom SolarNetwork URL that get converted
into [SolarNode instructions][instructions] that execute immediately, with the instruction results
converted into an external message response.

We call this service Instruction Input Endpiont, or just ININ for short. Its purpose is to make it
possible to integrate systems that do not support ‚Äúnatively‚Äù working with the SolarNetwork API. This
is similar to the [Datum Input Endpoint][din], but for commands, not data.

For example, imagine you have a system that collects power generation statistics from various
systems via HTTP, using its own JSON message structure. The service knows how to make a request to a
URL with a message like:

```json
{"action":"power-report-request","identifier":"gx.9128430.a9f880"}
```

and it expects a response like:

```json
{"total-power":123456789}
```

A SolarNetwork API-aware service could leverage the [DatumExpression instruction][expr-instr] to
answer this report request, by asking one or more nodes to return the current power generation
across several sources and summing the results. With ININ it is possible for this service to post
its own message format to SolarNetwork and SolarNetwork will translate it into node instructions and
then translate the instruction results back into the expected message response format.

This is enabled by configuring an **Instruction Endpoint URL** in SolarNetwork, with a **Request
Transform** to convert the input message into node instructions and a **Response Transform** to
convert the instruction results into the output message.

Once set up, the message flow goes like this:

1. External system posts message to Instruction Endpoint URL
2. SolarNetwork executes the Request Transform on the input message, producing node instructions
3. SolarNetwork enqueues the node instructions, waiting for the results
4. The node(s) receive their instructions, execute them, and post the results back to SolarNetwork
5. SolarNetwork, having received the instruction results, executes the Response Transform on the results, producing the output message
6. SolarNetwork returns the output message to the external system

All these steps can happen in the blink of an eye, thanks to, well, computers! ü§ñ

## Simple management UI

We have added an easy-to-use ININ management user interface to [SolarNetwork][solaruser]. With
point-and-click simplicity you can provision as many ININ endpoints as you like. They become
available immediately.

We have also made it easy to test out the transform process, by providing a form where you can
post input data and inspect the converted output.

## Robust management API

The new [SolarUser ININ API][solaruser-inin-api] provides a complete API for managing ININ endpoints
within your SolarNetwork account. Each endpoint is independently configured with authorization and
transform settings.
