The SolarNetwork team has been looking for a good Open Source billing platform for a while now.

<!--more-->

The goal was to provide a billing solution for those who might want to create a distributed energy
company (i.e. likely to be leveraging solar PV deployed in multiple locations). We imagine that this
software might be leveraged by a forward thinking traditional or cooperative business.

Now we have it!  Leveraging a fork of the popular jbilling platform we have been creating our very
own "fully" Open Source (Richard Stallman would say ["Free
Software"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) as in freedom!) called
[SolarBilling](http://greenstage.co.nz/SolarBilling/introduction.html).  This is a billing platform
that integrates nicely with SolarNetwork and one which we can expand upon as needed.  We still have
more work to do, so stay tuned as we progress this development...
