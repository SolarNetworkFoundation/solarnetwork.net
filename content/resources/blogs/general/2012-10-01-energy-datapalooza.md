John Gorman was invited to represent SolarNetwork at the [Energy
Datapalooza](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/10/01/energy-datapalooza-unleashing-power-open-data-advance-our-energy-future)
at the White House in Washington, D.C. for the launch of some major innovation
in the open data space.

The main idea of the Energy Datapalooza was to open up
the [huge stores of datasets](http://www.data.gov/communities/node/48/events/energydatainitiative)
that the government has via web services, and allow entrepreneurs and innovators
to create new products and services from this data.

We really enjoyed the modern approach that U.S. CTO Todd Park and EDI director
Ian Kalin took towards software development - there was a ton of enthusiasm in
the audience attending the event, and you could just sense the broad impacts
that this endeavor is going to have on energy policy. It was cool, disruptive,
highly advanced, and also really fun!
