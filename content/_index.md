  <p>
    SolarNetwork is an open-source platform providing stable, neutral data-wrangling infrastructure
    so you can build modern energy apps, report on energy use and generation, and manage your energy assets.

  {{<deck-card title="Collects"
    img="/img/SN-CTO-Simple-Start.svg"
    alt="Diagram of a circle flying into an open box." >}}

    Before you can do anything, you need data. SolarNetwork already knows how to collect data
    from a large variety of devices and systems, and it is easy to add support for new integrations.

  {{</deck-card>}}

  {{<deck-card title="Collates"
    img="/img/SN-CTO-Single-Solution.svg"
    alt="Diagram of light bulb with branching paths underneath." >}}

    Data from different sources can present in different ways. SolarNetwork pulls your data
    together and puts it into a simple and cohesive form.

  {{<deck-card title="Empowers"
    img="/img/SN-CTO-Simple-Low-High.svg"
    alt="Diagram of a hollow cylinder under a downward-pointing arrow." >}}

    Useful data is accessible data. SolarNetwork makes your data easily available for your
    apps, reports, and operations, whether you need the fine details or a high-level overview.

  {{<deck-card title="Build"

    alt="Diagram of concentric circles with 4 arrows pointing outwards." >}}

    Youâ€™ve got a great idea for an Energy 2.0 application, but to make it work you need data from
    lots of different sources. SolarNetwork is a cloud-based platform that can take care of the data-wrangling for you,
    so you can get back to working on your great idea, not the details of data infrastructure.

  {{</deck-card>}}

  {{<deck-card title="Report"
    img="/img/SN-CTO-Simplify.svg"
    alt="Diagram of concentric circles split into quadrants." >}}

    You need to report on your organisation's energy use and generation. SolarNetwork makes it easy
    to pull the data you need into your reporting system, regardless of the number of
    data sources or complexity of information involved.

  {{</deck-card>}}

  {{<deck-card title="Manage"
    img="/img/SN-CTO-Data-Security.svg"
    alt="Diagram of padlock surrounded by orbiting arrows." >}}

    You manage energy assets distributed across many sites. SolarNetwork makes monitoring data
    from your assets readily available and provides you with the means to control their operation.
