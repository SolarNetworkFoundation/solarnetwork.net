{{<section/column class="sn-alt" title="How it works">}}
SolarNetwork is an open source energy management platform that enables our users to monitor,
control, and optimise their energy ecosystem in real-time.

  {{<deck-card title="SolarNode"

    alt="Icon for a SolarNode computer device." >}}

    SolarNode is the swiss army knife for IoT monitoring and control. It is deployed on inexpensive
    computers in homes, buildings, vehicles, and even EV chargers, connected to any number of
    sensors, meters, building automation systems, and more.

  {{<deck-card title="SolarNet"
    img="/img/how-it-works/solarnet-icon.svg"
    alt="Icon for SolarNet cloud service." >}}

    A secure and scalable cloud platform for storing and retrieving data collected by SolarNode
    devices. With SolarNet you can instruct and administer nodes remotely, no matter your distance.
  {{</deck-card>}}

  {{<deck-card title="SolarApp"
    img="/img/how-it-works/cloud-app.svg"
    alt="Icon for a SolarApp application." >}}

    Your own application integrated with SolarNetwork through the SolarNet API, able to make
    meaningful decisions from the data collected by your nodes and take action to manage the devices
    connected to them.

<p>
  Our platform works night and day, gathering data from SolarNode devices. Nodes are deployed on
  energy generating assets like solar arrays or wind farms, storage devices like batteries, and
  energy consumers like homes and electric vehicles. As power is transferred between generators and
  consumers, the nodes collect data and send it to SolarNet, allowing your own applications to track
  and manage the flows of energy.

<p>
Imagine a day in the life of SolarNetwork as used by an electric lines company that needs to manage
the load on the grid.
