SolarNetwork is a service hosted by SolarNetwork Foundation (SNF) for sharing and viewing a variety
of energy-related data, such as photovoltaic solar generation and electricity consumption.
SolarNetwork aims to foster awareness of energy use and stimulate ideas on both reducing energy
waste and increasing energy efficiency.

SolarNetwork is free to use for personal hobby use. If you would like to use SolarNetwork for
commercial purposes, please contact info@solarnetwork.net to engage SNF in purchasing a low-cost
paid [subscription](/subscriptions.html) based on your SolarNetwork usage (you only pay for what you
use). Subscribers gain access to additional features like CSV data import and export.

SNF does not collect data other than what you explicitly add to SolarNetwork. SNF does not share any
of your personal information with anyone. The data published to SolarNetwork by SolarNodes is, by
default, publicly available at anonymous levels of detail via the SolarNetwork SolarQuery web API.
This can be disabled if desired by changing the node settings to "Private" mode, making the data
published by that node available only via security tokens you create in your SolarNetwork account.

SNF does not make any claims of ownership to any of the data collected by SolarNetwork. Please
contact info@solarnetwork.net if you would like any of your data extracted or removed from
SolarNetwork. For more detailed information, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy)
and [Terms of Service](#terms-of-service).

<h1>Subscriptions</h1>
<h2>Subscription period</h2>
<p>The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually), depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.</p>
<h2>Subscription cancellations</h2>
<p>You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings page or by contacting the Company.
You will not receive a refund for the fees You already paid for Your current Subscription period and You will be able to access the Service until the end of Your current Subscription period.</p>
<h2>Billing</h2>
<p>You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.</p>

<p>The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
