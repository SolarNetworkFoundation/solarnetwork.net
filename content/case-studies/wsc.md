Western Springs College is one of the largest public schools in West Auckland, with a student roll
of over 2300 students between years 9 and 13. Known historically for its co-governance with Nga Puna
o Waiorea and its strength in the performing arts, the College also cultivated a deep focus on
environmental stewardship and wanted to demonstrate this in their curriculum and with a new
state-of-the-art building. Baked into the original design of the building was the option of
attaching solar modules to the north facing roof, but the WSC community wondered how it would
finance such a project, and use it to “walk the talk” of sustainability, teach science curriculum,
and save money on energy bills.

## The challenge

 * Design a properly sized PV array for the actual school loads at time of construction, leaving
   options for growth in the future
 * Fund the design, construction and deployment of that solar array
 * Monitor the total building loads and solar generation in real time and visualise them together
 * Create a “data laboratory” for students and teachers to use as part of a curriculum on
   sustainability

## Evidence-based design

Western Springs College decided to use an evidence-based approach to this challenge, and that’s
where SolarNetwork Foundation got involved. WSC installed two SolarNodes measuring the loads and
power quality of their power from the grid, using low cost but reliable meters. By correlating this
time-series data with utility bills, they were able to understand how the older buildings and the
new building used electricity. This let WSC make an informed decision on the best solar system
design for their needs, and how they might expand the system in the future.

## Making it a reality

Once the design of the system was settled, WSC faced another challenge: how to fund it? The best
answer, as always, came from the community: WSC solicited sponsorship donations for individual solar
panels. Western Springs families, groups of friends, sports teams, and alumni worked together to
amass the funds needed to build the system. As enthusiastic donations rolled in, donors were
highlighted in a permanent exhibit at the school, and their names were acknowledged on the school’s
website in thanks and celebration.

Meanwhile, SolarNetwork Foundation helped WSC build a web-based SolarNetwork dashboard app that
visualised live and historic performance data of the school’s solar generation and grid energy use.
The school installed a large TV screen in the main lobby of the Ken Havill Centre for Learning and
attached a SolarKiosk computer to display the app where everyone could see.

## Future learning

WSC plans on tapping the SolarNetwork API and data visualisation tools like Grafana to allow
students and teachers to illustrate energy use patterns as part of the science curriculum, using
empirical data that they both own and control, extracted right from their own campus. This data will
be instrumental in optimal planning for the next stage of WSC’s journey in sustainability, whether
that is battery storage, dynamic water cylinder heating, EV charging, or something new for the
community to explore and learn about.
