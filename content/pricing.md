SolarNetwork Foundation offers a usage-based pricing model for the SolarNetwork platform which is
based on how much you utilise the platform. For example you pay for the amount of data collected into
and queried out of the platform.

The following **basic** SolarNetwork features are available to all users, including the
[âˆ…Energy](#on-demand-monthly-packages) free tier:

{{<table>}}
| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| SolarNode | Deploy any number of SolarNode edge compute devices to collect data from any number of components (solar inverters, meters, and so on). |
| SolarQuery | Query all the data collected by SolarNode devices. |
| SolarFlux | Real-time access to data collected by SolarNode devices. |
| Instructions     | [Send commands](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarUser-API#queue-instruction) to SolarNode devices, for example to toggle a switch or adjust a setpoint on a component. |
{{</table>}}

By signing up to the [milliWatt](#on-demand-monthly-packages) or higher package you gain access to the following **core** SolarNetwork features:

{{<table>}}
| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Priority support | Support straight from the SolarNetwork experts. |
| Bulk import      | [Import CSV data](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarUser-Datum-Import-API) into SolarNetwork. |
| Bulk export      | [Export CSV data](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarUser-Datum-Export-API) out of SolarNetwork, on an automated schedule or as a one-off. |
{{</table>}}

By signing up to the [kiloWatt](#on-demand-monthly-packages) or higher package you gain access to the following additional SolarNetwork features:

{{<table>}}
| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Cloud integration | Acquire data from [external device cloud services]({{<ref "2024-11-06-cloud-integrations">}}), without using a SolarNode device to collect the data. |
| Custom HTTP integration | Deploy [custom HTTP data integration URLs]({{<ref "2024-03-05-din">}}) that can convert and import arbitrary data formats into SolarNetwork, without using a SolarNode device to collect the data. |
| Custom HTTP instruction integration | Deploy [custom instruction integration URLs]({{<ref "2024-04-21-inin">}}) that can convert arbitrary messages into SolarNode instructions. |
| DNP3 integration | Integrate with [Distributed Network Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNP3) Control Center applications by way of a fully managed [DNP3 Remote Substation (Outstation)]({{<ref "2023-08-20-dnp3">}}) instance. A single Outstation can expose data and control points across any node associated with your SolarNetwork account. SolarNetwork provides a [robust API](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarUser-DNP3-API) for managing DNP3 configuration. |
| Event hooks      | Integrate with external applications based on [events]({{<ref "2020-06-19-event-hooks-api">}}) happening within SolarNetwork. |
| OCPP integration | Integrate electric vehicle charging stations with your SolarNetwork account via the Open Charge Point Protocol from the [Open Charge Alliance](https://www.openchargealliance.org/). SolarNetwork acts as an OCPP [Central Service]({{<ref "2022-05-16-ocpp-ui">}}) and offers a [robust API](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarUser-OCPP-API) to manage the integration. |
| OSCP integration | Receive load control signals from an [Open Smart Charging Protocol](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/oscp-20/) Capacity Provider. SolarNetwork acts as an OSCP [Flexibility Provider]({{<ref "2023-02-14-oscp-ui">}}) and offers a [robust API](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarUser-OSCP-API) to integrate your own Capacity Optimizer service. |
