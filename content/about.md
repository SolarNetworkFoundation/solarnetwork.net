Back in 2008, when a couple of dads hanging out in an Auckland playground got to talking, the pair
quickly realised they had some things in common.

Both were U.S. expats; both had a keen interest in the environment; both were software developers.

You don't meet someone who shares your interests every day. Especially when those interests include
an open-source public infrastructure for energy management.

Pretty soon the two had gathered a couple of solar panels, charge controllers, deep-cycle batteries,
miniature PCs, and they climbed their roofs to install the gear - forgetting that their children
were still at the playground. Just kidding. Over the next weeks and months they wrote the code that
would become the SolarNetwork platform.

Today SolarNetwork is used by schools, corporations, governments, solar integrators, and developers
in numerous apps that display and control dynamic energy flows in new and novel ways.

SolarNetwork and its founders have been recognized by awards and invitations to conferences and
brainstorming sessions across the world, from the Asian Development Bank to the White House.

### About the name

The SolarNetwork project began with tracking the energy produced by solar panels and collecting this
data over the internet. But the goal has always been bigger than just solar panels. We want people
to consider the entire energy ecosystem and all of the its elements: weather, market prices,
electric vehicles, and the effects of these elements on the climate.

We still use _solar_ to describe ourselves because the energy produced by the sun either provides or
directly influences all aspects of an energy enrvironment. _Network_ can be thought of as both the
physical network provided by the internet as well as the social aspect of people sharing a common
interest in energy and the environment. In this way, _SolarNetwork_ was named.

### Our mission

SolarNetwork Foundation was established in 2017 to serve as a curator and promoter of the open
codebase and data-driven process that comprise the SolarNetwork platform. The Foundation's work is
guided by our belief in:

* open source computing
* data-driven methodology
* open access to data

We celebrate the innovations emerging from the community of developers, enthusiasts, and business
leaders who share these values.

Our mission is to protect and preserve the environment by supporting energy education, and to use
technology to engage people for the purposes of energy awareness, conservation, and the uptake of
renewable energy sources.
