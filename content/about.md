It was back in 2008 when a couple of dads hanging out in an Auckland playground got to talking. The
pair quickly realised they had a couple of things common.

Both were U.S. expats with a keen interest in environmental technology.

It is not everyday that you meet some one who is equally interested in an open-source, public
infrastructure that uses the internet two bridge renewable energy data streams, regardless of
hardware to produce energy.

Pretty soon the two had gathered a couple of solar panels, charge controllers, deep-cycle batteries,
miniature PCs, and climbed their roofs to install the gear - forgetting that their children were
still at the playground. Just kidding. Over the next weeks and months they wrote the code that would
become the SolarNetwork platform.

Today SolarNetwork is used by schools, corporations, governments, solar integrators, and developers
in numerous apps that display and control dynamic energy flows in new and novel ways.

SolarNetwork and its founders have been recognized by awards and invitations to conferences and
brainstorming sessions across the world: from the Asian Development Bank to the White House.

### About the name

The project began with tracking the energy produced by solar panels and collecting this data through
the internet. But the goal has always been bigger than just solar. We want people to consider the
entire energy ecosystem and all of the its elements: weather, market prices, electric cars, and the
effects of these elements this on the climate.

We like to think of solar in the sense that this energy is part of a wider ecosystem, which directly
or indirectly affects all aspects of an energy environment. Additionally, network can be thought of
as both the physical network provided by the internet as well as the social aspect of people sharing
a common interest in energy and the environment. And thus, SolarNetwork was born. Our mission

SolarNetwork Foundation was established in 2017 to serve as a curator and promoter of the open
codebase and data-driven process that comprise the SolarNetwork platform. The Foundation's work is
guided by our belief in:

* open source computing
* data-driven methodology
* open access to data

We celebrate the innovations emerging from the community of developers, enthusiasts, and business
leaders who share these values.

Our mission is to protect and preserve the environment by supporting energy education, and to use
technology to engage people for the purposes of energy awareness, conservation, and the uptake of
renewable energy sources.
