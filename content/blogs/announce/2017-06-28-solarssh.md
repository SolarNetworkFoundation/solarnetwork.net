SolarNode devices generally don't require much maintenance once they are initially deployed and
configured. Like any IoT device, however, they do require periodic maintenance, for example to apply
security patches or add/update SolarNode plugins.

SolarNodes provide two main methods for administrative and maintenance tasks:

 1. use a web browser to access the SolarNode setup GUI
 2. use a SSH client to access the SolarNode OS shell

Both of these methods require network access from you to the node, but SolarNode devices are
often deployed into networks where it can be very hard, or even impossible, to access them over the
network. Essentially they can make **outbound** connections (to post the data they collect to
SolarNetwork), but there isn't a way for **inbound** connections (from you to the node) to reach
them.

SolarNetwork now supports a way to work around this limitation, and we call it **SolarSSH**.
SolarSSH allows you to access both the SolarNode setup GUI and the OS shell from a web browser. It
works by using a SSH proxy to act as an intermediate server that both the SolarNode device you want
to administer, and your web browser, connect to. SolarNode connects to SolarSSH securely via SSH
(hence, the name SolarSSH) and your web browser connects to SolarSSH securely via HTTPS. Once both
systems are connected to SolarSSH, SolarSSH acts as both a web proxy for you to access the SolarNode
setup GUI and a telnet proxy via a WebSocket connection for you to access the SolarNode OS shell.

Here is a diagram that shows how the various components involved with SolarSSH initiate network
connections, and the protocols used:

We don't want nodes to establish and maintain permanent SSH connections to SolarSSH. Instead we need
a way to toggle the SolarSSH connection on and off, on demand. To accomplish that, SolarSSH uses the
exisiting SolarNetwork [Instruction API][instr-api], via the new [StartRemoteSsh][start-ssh] and
[StopRemoteSsh][stop-ssh] instructions.

SolarSSH exposes a [REST API][api] for applications to interact with. We've written a JavaScript
[package][js-npm] that makes using the API [a breeze][js-doc], and then a basic application using that package
called [SolarSSH Web Terminal][webterm] that allows you to access the SolarNode setup GUI and OS
shell of nodes deployed with SolarSSH support, all from your web browser. Here is a demo of using
SolarSSH Web Terminal to connect to a remote SolarNode:

We've been using SolarSSH to remotely administer nodes, some connected to the internet via public
mobile networks, to great success.
