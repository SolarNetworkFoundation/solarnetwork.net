SolarNetwork has supported [OCPP][ocpp]-compliant EV charging stations [for a couple of years
now][ocpp-api-post], but only via [SolarUser API methods][solaruser-ocpp-api]. Now SolarUser
supports a simple OCPP management user interface, so the OCPP infrastructure can be managed easily
in a browser.

The UI looks like this:
