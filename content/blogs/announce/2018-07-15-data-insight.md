SolarNetwork has a new feature that helps you see an overview of the data collected by SolarNodes in
your account, at a glance. The new **Data Insight** page shows you a tally of the number of nodes in
your account, and the number of unique sources they are posting data under.

The page also shows a
tally of all the data collected by all nodes and **stored** in SolarNetwork. Finally, it shows a
tally of all the data **posted** and **queried** by all nodes in the last 30 days, per node and
source.

For accounts on paid subscriptions, all these numbers can help you estimate how much your
subscription costs will be month to month.
