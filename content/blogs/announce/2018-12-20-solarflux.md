title: SolarFlux â€” real-time SolarNode data via MQTT

SolarNetwork has a new feature that provides access to SolarNode data in real-time, which we are
calling SolarFlux. The system allows applications to access the real-time data via the [MQTT][mqtt]
publish/subscribe protocol.

<!--more-->

This is an opt-in feature on SolarNode, provided by a new [SolarFlux
Upload Service][solarflux-upload] plugin. Once this plugin is deployed on a node, the node will
publish real-time data to the SolarFlux system. At that point, any application can connect to
SolarFlux using MQTT over a [WebSocket][websocket] (so it works from a browser) and subscribe to
data topics to receive real-time updates.

See the [SolarFlux wiki docs][api-docs] for more information.

## Demo

We've put together a simple [demo application][solarflux-demo] to show how it works. This is a web
application that shows how you can use JavaScript to connect to SolarFlux and show real-time data
published by any nodes you have authorization to.
