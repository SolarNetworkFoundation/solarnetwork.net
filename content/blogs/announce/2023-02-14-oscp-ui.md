SolarNetwork recently added [Open Smart Charging Protocol][oscp-api-post] support for dynamic grid
load management, but configuring everything was only available through [SolarUser API
methods][solaruser-oscp-api]. Now SolarNetwork supports a simple OSCP management user interface, so
the OSCP infrastructure can be managed easily in a browser.

The UI looks like this:

Configuring the integration with a Capacity Provider or Capacity Optimizer can be done in a simple
form:

Capacity Groups are organised with Flexibility Assets, which are associated with datum streams to
enable automatic OSCP measurement reporting:
